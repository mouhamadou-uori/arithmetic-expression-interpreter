Arithmetic Expression Interpreter


This project aims to develop a C program capable of reading an arithmetic expression provided as input, checking its syntax, and, if it is correct, 
evaluating the value of the expression. The program will be designed to work with a wide variety of arithmetic expressions, including addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and the use of parentheses to define the order of evaluation. 
The main objective is to provide a reliable and accurate tool for performing arithmetic operations, while ensuring compliance with syntactic rules.
